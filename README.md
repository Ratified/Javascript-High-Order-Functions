# HIGH ORDER JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONS
- High-order functions are a powerful concept in JavaScript that can greatly enhance the flexibility and reusability of your code. 

## What is a High-Order Function?
- A high-order function is a function that either:


1. Takes one or more functions as arguments, or
2. Returns a function as its result.


## Common High-Order Functions
- JavaScript provides several built-in high-order functions, especially for array operations. Some of the most commonly used high-order functions include:

1. `map`: Creates a new array by applying a function to each element of an existing array.
2. `filter`: Creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
3. `reduce`: Executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.
4. `forEach`: Executes a provided function once for each array element.
5. `sort`: Sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the array.
